### <a name="features"></a><b><i>What it is and how it works:</i></b>

My name is Antonio Liberal, I am a software developer and I have had Parkinson's for a few years, so I created Mouse Helper to improve the stability of the mouse when my hand shakes.

Like any other Parkinsonian, the biggest problems we encounter when handling the mouse are:

* We need to slow down in order to do precision tasks, like changing the width of a column.
* Because our fingers shake, we sometimes click unintentionally.
* Drag & drop operations are often an ordeal. Many times we unintentionally drag a file into a folder.

Even if you do not have the disease, this program can also be useful for you: Try it and if you like it, make a donation to any association (if it is Parkinson's, better ...)
